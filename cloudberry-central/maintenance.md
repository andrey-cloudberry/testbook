## Managing maintenance

### Introduction

When you initially purchase a product, it only includes a lifetime license. However, maintenance for the product — which includes upgrades and support — has to be purchased separately and will cost you 20% of the product’s price. In other words, acquiring a maintenance for $299 CloudBerry Backup Ultimate edition would set you back $60. In this article we explain how to effortlessly purchase maintenance for all your CloudBerry products via CloudBerry Central. Bear in mind that you can also purchase maintenance via out website, yet we strongly recommend you do it via CloudBerry Central so as to avoid issues with different email addresses \(it’s crucial that the email address you use to purchase maintenance is identical to your CloudBerry Central login\).

### Purchasing a single maintenance

Go to [CloudBerry Central](http://cloudberrycentral.com/). If you don't know what it is, read [our article](/cloudberry-central/getting-started-with-cloudberry-central.md) that explains it in detail as well as the sign up process. Once you've singed up, you can go ahead and purchase maintenance.
