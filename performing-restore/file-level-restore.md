## Restoring files in CloudBerry Backup

Restoring files in CloudBerry Backup can be accomplished in just a few simple steps. In short, you indicate the storage that contains the files, select the files that need to be restored, optionally specify a few extra options and you're all set. In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to do just that.

To restore files, launch CloudBerry Backup. On the main toolbar, click **Restore**. Alternatively, utilize the Ctrl+R shortcut.

If you enabled encryption when backing up, enter the encryption password. If you've forgotten it, the data is permanently gone.
